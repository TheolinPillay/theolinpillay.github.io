<div><h3>First-year Mentor (Aug 2019 - Oct 2019)</h3>
<p>
<b>I was approached by the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal Teaching & Learning Unit to take on the
role of First-year mentor due to my good performance in second year. My responsibilities included facilitating
conversations with students to help them better understang IT topics that they struggle with. There is no
set teaching plan or content to present during these sessions. It is however a freestyle type of class
where they can ask any questions that need clarity. At the end of each session, I have to record students who are present
and present the list to my Academic Development Officer/Supervisor.</p></b></div>

<h3>General Assistant (Apr 2022 - May 2023)</h3>
<p><b>I volunteered to provide my services to Newholmes Pharmacy (Pty) Ltd where I was delegated the
responsibility of reconciling stock order invoices for each supplier. This included checking that all
invoices are present and ordered by their invoice number. I therefore had to cross off invoice numbers
on the invoice statement for each invoice with a matching invoice number. For invoices that are missing,
I have to show my supervisor the invoice numbers that are not crossed off on the statement and then
find the invoices and put them in order. Doctor's scripts and reciepts are also ordered and sorted by me
when necessary. Additionally, I also help pack medicines onto shelves and also 
prepare medicines (meaning that I put 20 capsules for each bottle or jar of a medicine, for example).
Yovishka Ghirdarie, the supervisor assigned to me, has made sure that my work was completed and up to date.</b>
