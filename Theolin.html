<p><b>Here are some facts about myself and my accomplishments achieved:</b></p>
</aside>

<div>

<h2>My personality</h2>
<p><b>
I am usually shy and introverted. I like to stay at home by myself and I rarely go out with friends. I do
find it hard to start a conversation with someone and usually wait for the other person to engage. I am thus
not a person who stands out and makes a presence. I am a good-hearted, helpful and kind person. I value hard
work and persistance, which is why I was a good student from a young age. I also do not
like being aggressive or angry to others. My Asperger's syndrome makes it difficult for me to interact with new
people and is the reason for my compulsive behaviours and different mentality. </b>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>My Background</h2>
<p><b>I was born and raised in Pietermaritzburg, specifically in a predominantly Indian area called Raisethorpe.
I am the youngest of three siblings in my family. My sister and brother are older than me by 13 and 14 years
respectively. I was very close to my parents as I would always go with them
on their usual grocery runs or place of work. They always disciplined me and were very strict.<br> My mother died
from stage four cancer in 2013 and my father died from covid-pneumonia in 2023. My mom always valued educatiion as
a powerful asset in her life which explains her Master's degree in Education and her job as
a Grade 2 teacher. My father worked most of his life
as a sales representative at a truck spares company and always panelbeating on the side, adding a wide range
of vehicles to his portfolio.  I am closer to my
sister than my brother because she is more open and kind-hearted, whereas my brother is rebellious and distant.
I used to visit my cousin from my mother's side alot and always played video games together. However, times
have changed and we grew distant. I could also say the same for my cousin from my father's side.</b></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>My Interests</h2>
<p><b>I developed a passion for cars at a young age and watched a lot of car-action movies and played many racing
video games. I have also swayed towards superheroes and cartoons, with my favourite characters as Spider-Man, Hulk,
and SpongeBob SquarePants. I am a big fan of Manchester United football club and like to watch analyses from
sky sports and Premier League and Champions League games. I grew up around dogs and our family has a rich history
of dogs.</b></p>
