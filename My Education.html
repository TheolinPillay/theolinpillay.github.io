<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I was a very well-behaved, quiet and focused student who applies myself to the best of his ability. I performed very well in most
of my classes and thrives in engaging and active classroom environments. I enjoyed geograpghy, biology and
accounting in high school. He was appreciated by many school teachers and always recieved positive praise.
During university, I have gained recognition into the Golden Key International Honour Society for his high
class marks. </p>

<p>This page represents my educational background from high school to university. 
I place greater emphasis on my university performance instead of high school performance.</p>

<p><b>I developed extreme OCD that significantly affected my academic performance. I had tuition to help boost
my grades and went to a psychologist to help treat my OCD. There was no change to my condition and my mid-year
exams were terrible. Only after July did things finally turn around. Although I couldn't get back to the same
high performance that I had during my previous grades, I managed to salvage what I can and eventually pulled through.</b>
